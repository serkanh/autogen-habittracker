      "\n",
      "2. **Build the Authentication system**: Use Firebase Authentication for managing user accounts. Create the necessary screens for registration and login.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Design the Database Schema**: Plan the structure of the data to be stored. This will include user data, habits, and progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Implement Habit Creation and Tracking**: Create the UI for adding new habits and marking them as done. Implement the logic for tracking progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Implement Notifications**: Use the react-native-push-notification library to schedule notifications.\n",
      "\n",

      "Alright, let's start setting up the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initialize the project**: First, we need to initialize a new React Native project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "npx react-native init HabitTracker\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Install dependencies**: After the project has been initialized, navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies. Here are the commands to install them:\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "cd HabitTracker\n",
      "\n",
      "# Install react-navigation\n",
      "npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack\n",
      "\n",
      "# Install react-native-paper for Material Design components\n",
      "npm install react-native-paper\n",
      "\n",
      "# Install react-native-push-notification for local notifications\n",
      "npm install react-native-push-notification\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Setup Firebase**: We will be using Firebase for user authentication and data storage. To set it up, first install the Firebase SDK by running:\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "npm install firebase\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, you need to create a new Firebase project from the Firebase console and get your configuration details. These details should be added to your project as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "import * as firebase from 'firebase';\n",
      "\n",
      "const firebaseConfig = {\n",
      "  apiKey: \"YOUR_API_KEY\",\n",
      "  authDomain: \"YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN\",\n",
      "  databaseURL: \"YOUR_DATABASE_URL\",\n",
      "  projectId: \"YOUR_PROJECT_ID\",\n",
      "  storageBucket: \"YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET\",\n",
      "  messagingSenderId: \"YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID\",\n",
      "  appId: \"YOUR_APP_ID\"\n",
      "};\n",
      "\n",
      "firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Create the directory structure**: Plan and create the directory structure for your project. A possible structure could be:\n",
      "\n",
      "- src\n",
      "  - components\n",
      "  - screens\n",
      "  - services\n",
      "  - utils\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Start building the screens**: You can now start building the screens for your app. You can start with the authentication screens (Register and Login) and then move on to the main screens (Habit List, Add Habit, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to commit your changes regularly and push them to a remote repository for safekeeping. Happy coding!\n",
      "\n",

      "Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:\n",

      "```\n",

      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "npx react-native init HabitTracker\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Check for conflicts**: If you have the `react-native` package installed globally, it might conflict with the `react-native-cli` package. You can check if this is the case by running `npm list -g --depth=0`. If the `react-native` package is listed, you can remove it by running `npm uninstall -g react-native`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Reinstall Node.js and npm**: If none of the above solutions work, there might be an issue with your Node.js or npm installation. In this case, you can try reinstalling Node.js and npm. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).\n",
      "\n",
      "After trying these solutions, you should be able to initialize a new React Native project without any issues.\n",
